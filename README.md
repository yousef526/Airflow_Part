# Airflow_Part

This repository provides a foundational setup for Apache Airflow using Docker Compose.
It includes essential configurations and a sample DAG to help users get started with workflow orchestration and scheduling.

## Features

- **Dockerized Environment**: Utilizes Docker and Docker Compose for easy setup and deployment.
- **Sample DAG**: Includes a basic DAG located in the `dags/` directory to demonstrate task scheduling.
- **Predefined Configurations**: Comes with a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` for streamlined setup.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yousef526/Airflow_Part.git

   ```

2. **Initialize Airflow**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up airflow-init
   ```

3. **Start the Airflow Services**:

## Notifications via Email

To enable email notifications (e.g., task success/failure alerts), you need to configure SMTP settings in Airflow.

Update your `airflow.cfg` or environment variables with the following:

```ini
[smtp]
smtp_host = smtp.example.com
smtp_starttls = True
smtp_ssl = False
smtp_user = your-email@example.com
smtp_password = your-password
smtp_port = 587
smtp_mail_from = airflow@example.com
```

> 📌 Make sure your SMTP provider allows external access and the credentials are correct.
